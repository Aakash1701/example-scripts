# example-scripts
- Example scripts originally derived from Prof. Dana Tomlin's handouts for his course on Geospatial Software Design. 
Shared with his permission with the intention that the examples will be maintained by the Earth Engine user community. 
- We aim to have examples in both Javascript and Python, but will begin with adding Javascript examples initially.
- The layout of the pages will be as follows:
