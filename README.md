# example-scripts
- Example scripts originally derived from [Prof. Dana Tomlin](https://www.design.upenn.edu/landscape-architecture/people/c-dana-tomlin)'s handouts for his course on [Geospatial Software Design](http://environment.yale.edu/courses/2017-2018/detail/754/). Shared with his permission with the intention that the examples will be maintained by the Earth Engine user community. 
- We aim to have examples in both JavaScript and Python, but will begin with adding Javascript examples initially.
- The layout of the pages will be as follows:  

# Name of Method

## Syntax

#### JavaScript
```

```

#### Python

```

## Examples
